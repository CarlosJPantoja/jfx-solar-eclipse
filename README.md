# Solar Eclipse 🌗

_Here you can see a simulation of a solar eclipse at different speeds and stop it whenever you want._

Now to start playing you have two buttons at the bottom, one to move and another to stop. Once the solar eclipse begins and the moon is approaching the sun, the background will begin to turn a darker color, simulating the eclipse. In turn, the stars and planets will shine differently, the stars that twinkle differently from the light of the planets, which is static.

## here you can see some images with the stages of the solar eclipse
